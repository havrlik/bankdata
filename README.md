# bankdata

A collection on bank data all over the world

The collection starts with [IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number#Adoption) countries:
- these countries are members in [SEPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area) and use [â‚¬URo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone) (Germany, France, ... or Malta) or their own currency (Sweden, ... Switzerland)
- there are also non SEPA countries, which use IBAN (United Arab Emirates, Brazil, ... Ukraine)

Banks in the United States, Australia, ... and Canadian financial institutions have not adopted IBAN and use their own Systems for domestic transfers, and SWIFT for international transfers.
