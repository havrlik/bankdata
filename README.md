# bankdata
A collection on bank data all over the world

The collection starts with [IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number#Adoption) countries:
- these countries are members in [SEPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area) and use [â‚¬ EURo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone) (Germany, France, ... or Malta) or their own currency (Sweden, ... Switzerland)
- there are also non SEPA countries, which use IBAN (United Arab Emirates, Brazil, ... Ukraine)
